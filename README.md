## üé® Pochoir Maker

PochoirMaker is a peculiar tool that helps you selectively transform any picture into a pure black & white cutout, stencil-style, better than any automated filter.

Most photographs don't make good stencils right away because of their uneven levels. For instance, one half of a face will be shadowed while the other half will be bright, hence **a threshold filter applied uniformly will always burn some parts** into pure black or pure white, making it a real pain to get a useable result.

PochoirMaker aims to let you guide the filtering by freezing parts of the image when they look best, then moving on with other parts at a different threshold value. This way you end up with a well-balanced black & white image, ready for a bit of cleaning and/or vectorizing.

#### Features

- Import JPG, PNG, BMP, TIF images of any size (be reasonable though).
- Interactive Threshold filter to pick just the right level from 0 to 255.
- Optional Simplification and Median filters to remove noise and small details.
- Mask painting to freeze specific parts of the image when they look best.
- Ugly and cumbersome UI that can't be resized.

#### Prerequisites

This tool was originally made as a .py script, thus requiring a working Python environment + a few dependencies:

```
pip install opencv-python pillow numpy
```

But I'm a lazy guy and I hate it when, after a few years, a useful script stops working because some dependency update broke it... So I compiled PochoirMaker into a sexy 59 MB .exe, thanks to PyInstaller. Anyone with a decent Windows PC can use the .exe, you don't need Python, there's nothing to install, it's all self-contained and portable.

### üõ†Ô∏è How to use

On opening PochoirMaker you will be prompted to select an input file, then you will see the black & white filtered image (no, you can't zoom in or out ‚Äì sorry about that). Try different values for **Simplification and Median** to stylize the shapes to your liking. My go-to setting is Simplification: 1 and Median: 3.

Use the **right mouse button to pan** the viewport, use the **left mouse button to paint** a green mask that will freeze the covered areas. As soon as you change the Threshold value, your active mask (green) will be merged into the final mask (blue). You can **change the brush size** using the related slider.

Press the [E] key to toggle **Eraser mode** and remove parts of the masks ‚Äì that's as close to an Undo feature as you will get. Press the [S] key at any time to prompt a "Save As..." dialog box. The saved image is a PNG named after the input file + a "_pochoir" suffix and a version number; each time you save your work, the file name will be incremented. You are of course free to name it differently.

#### Source

You may find the code of PochoirMaker is messy and unprofessional: that's totally normal. I'm not a developer and had ChatGPT churn it all out, following my directions (in French üá´üá∑ ). But the tool is fully functional, it doesn't crash and does what it's asked. And I made a cute icon for it!

If you feel like improving this tool, adding features like zoom in/out, undo/redo ‚Äì please do so! I'm not claiming ownership on any of this and would love to see people use and improve it.
